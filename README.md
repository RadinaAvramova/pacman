# Pacman
Welcome to Pacman! Pacman is a classic arcade game where players control a yellow, circular character known as Pac-Man through a maze. The objective is to eat all the dots while avoiding ghosts roaming the maze. This README will guide you through the installation, features, and usage of Pacman.

## Installation

## Features
Pacman offers the following features:

**Classic Arcade Gameplay:** Experience the classic arcade gameplay of Pacman, where players navigate a maze, eat dots, and avoid ghosts.

**Maze Layouts:** Play through various maze layouts, each with its own unique design and challenges. Mazes may feature different configurations of dots, power pellets, and obstacles.

**Power Pellets:** Collect power pellets to temporarily turn the tables on ghosts, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for extra points.

**Fruit Bonuses:** Eat fruit that appears in the maze for bonus points. Fruit bonuses may appear at certain intervals or under specific conditions.

**Ghost AI:** Encounter different types of ghosts with unique behaviors and movement patterns. Some ghosts may chase Pac-Man relentlessly, while others may patrol specific areas or exhibit random movements.

**High Scores:** Compete for high scores by completing levels quickly, eating all dots, and avoiding ghosts. Track your progress and aim to beat your personal best or challenge friends for the top spot.

**Level Progression:** Advance through levels of increasing difficulty as you complete mazes and achieve high scores. Each level may introduce new challenges or variations in gameplay.

## Usage
Using Pacman is simple:

1. **Start a New Game:** Begin by starting a new game session. Choose the desired game mode or level, if applicable, and Pac-Man will appear in the maze ready to eat dots.

2. **Navigate the Maze:** Use the arrow keys (or on-screen controls) to navigate Pac-Man through the maze. Pac-Man will move in the direction indicated by the keys pressed.

3. **Eat Dots:** Guide Pac-Man to eat all the dots scattered throughout the maze. Eating dots earns points and clears the maze.

4. **Avoid Ghosts:** Be careful to avoid ghosts roaming the maze. If Pac-Man collides with a ghost, a life will be lost. Use power pellets strategically to temporarily turn ghosts blue and eat them for extra points.

5. **Collect Power Pellets and Fruit:** Eat power pellets to turn ghosts blue and gain temporary invincibility. Additionally, eat fruit bonuses for extra points when they appear in the maze.

6. **Complete the Maze:** Eat all the dots in the maze to complete the level and advance to the next one. The game continues until all lives are lost or all levels are completed.
